# 🎯 API Endpoints Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

## 📊 Status: **SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### ✅ **API Department Endpoints Working:**

1. **GET /api/departments** - List all departments ✅
2. **GET /api/departments/{id}** - Get single department ✅  
3. **POST /api/departments/create** - Create new department ✅

---

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details:**

### 1. **API Base Architecture**
- **File:** `ci/application/controllers/API_Base.php`
- **Features:** 
  - CORS headers support
  - Standardized JSON responses
  - Error handling
  - Success/Error response methods

### 2. **Department API Controller**
- **File:** `ci/application/controllers/Api_department.php`
- **Endpoints:**
  - `departments()` - GET all departments with pagination
  - `department($id)` - GET single department by ID
  - `create()` - POST create new department
- **Features:**
  - JSON input handling
  - Database field mapping (d_id, d_name, d_date)
  - Proper error responses

### 3. **Database Model Enhanced**
- **File:** `ci/application/models/Department_list.php`
- **Methods Added:**
  - `get_departments_api()` - API-specific department listing
  - `get_department_by_id()` - Single department retrieval
  - `create_department()` - New department creation
  - `count_departments()` - Pagination support

### 4. **Database Schema Compatibility**
- **Table:** `department`
- **Columns:** 
  - `d_id` (Primary Key) → mapped to `id` in API
  - `d_name` → mapped to `name` in API
  - `d_date` → mapped to `created_at` in API
